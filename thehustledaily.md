Hey folks! Welcome to **The Hustle Daily** where I try my best to share what I am up to as of the
moment.

But first.

How are you doing?
What are you working on right now?  
Have you contributed to projects lately or are you working on getting that PR approved?  

Whatever that is you are working on, I'm interested to know more about it and maybe we can work
together!

In any case, this is what I'm hustling to right now.

- Reading <a href="http://railsspeed.com">The Complete Guide to Rails Performance</a> by Nate
  Berkopec.
- <a href="#">Taking Off With Elixir</a> by Rob Conery.
- I'm watching <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/">Destroy All Software</a> screencasts by Gary Bernhardt. I urge you to go and check it out. Really amazing content made by one of the best developers I have ever known.

I wish you the best of luck!
