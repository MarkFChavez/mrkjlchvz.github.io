Hey folks! Welcome to **The Hustle Daily** where I try my best to share what I am up to as of the
moment.

But first.

How are you doing?
What are you working on right now?  
Have you contributed to projects lately or are you working on getting that PR approved?  

Whatever that is you are working on, I'm interested to know more about it and maybe we can work
together!

In any case, this is what I'm hustling to right now.

As of Aug 23, 2017:

- Reading `Learn Functional Programming with Elixir`
- Playing with Elixir and Phoenix development
- Learning mobile app development with React Native

As of Sept 6, 2017:

- Learning Redux Integration with React Native
- Learning more about Javascript in general
- Almost done with the *React Native* course

### Goals

My goal is to be efficient in both *Elixir* and *Javascript* by the end of year. I
want to, at least, create something that is useful for developers. I'll talk
about it in details in the upcoming weeks.

By the end of this year, I should be capable of developing advanced mobile apps for both
iOS and android using *React Native*.

Happy reading!
