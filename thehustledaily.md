Hey folks! Welcome to **The Hustle Daily** where I try my best to share what I am up to as of the
moment.

But first.

How are you doing?
What are you working on right now?  
Have you contributed to projects lately or are you working on getting that PR approved?  

Whatever that is you are working on, I'm interested to know more about it and maybe we can work
together!

In any case, this is what I'm hustling to right now.

- Reading Dave Thomas' [Programming
  Elixir](https://pragprog.com/book/elixir13/programming-elixir-1-3)
- I am learning a JavaScript framework called [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- I am learning how to start an online business

I wish you the best of luck!
