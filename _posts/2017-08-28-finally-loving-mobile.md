title: Finally Loving Mobile Development
category: javascript

Looking back during the last 10 years or so, mobile apps are nothing but a stranger of this
world. Then suddenly, it boomed and went crazy. Nowadays, you can't see an individual without
a mobile phone.

To be honest, I've been trying to learn mobile development for quite a while. Then at
some point, I stopped and moved on again with web instead.

I don't know.

It seems that there is this some sort of negative energy or aura that makes me think I can't love
the mobile platform. And going back two weeks ago, I remembered my experiences way back in college.

### My college background

During college, I have this infinite amount of enthusiasm for programming. Basically, I was
specializing in building desktop apps back then using Java as my primary language. I build
apps everyday. Even after school, or during school hours. I loved it. I've built different
apps with the main purpose of improving my other people's life.

- I created a library management system.
- I created a grading system specifically for our school.
- I created a chat system for use in our home.
- I created an iTunes-like app that plays my own library of songs.
- *the list goes on...*

Those memories just came back at me and I realized how passionate I was during that time. For those
reasons, I was able to bring back that fire and motivation to continue along and learn a new thing.

### Fast forward to today

Today, I'm happy to say that I am halfway to finishing [The Complete React Native and Redux](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course) course
on Udemy and targeting to finish it in a span of two weeks. My primary goal is to be comfortable with
mobile development and build really useful apps for everyone.
